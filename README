*** Overview ***

This Code is an example, how to send JSON requests via TCP to a server. SSL could also be used, but is not applied here. The requested results are displayed in a UIViewController and logged.
This project uses code written by Cesare Rocchi: http://www.raywenderlich.com/3932/how-to-create-a-socket-based-iphone-app-and-server
and Jeff Lamarche: http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.de/2010/05/nsstream-tcp-and-ssl.html
